GeoTweets
=========

This was a small weekend project I worked on. It was my first time ever using the Google Maps or Twitter APIs.

How does it work? You can open it up by going to http://refact.io/geotweets and let it find your location.

From there (providing nothing is broken) you should see avatars on the map. This is the person & location of the tweet. You can hover of the avatar to see the tweet. If you click on the picture you'll be taken to the tweet on Twitter where you can then reply/favorite it.
